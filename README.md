# Adam Huszka Final Project

Notes:

- The social media links (in the sidebar menu and on the contact page) are still blind, as the client has not set up these yet

- In the additional content folder I have added all my work files, prototype, logo and background drafts plus the literature I used. 

- I added a second branch containing the top navbar version of the website, just to show a previous iteration. (Please note that this version has not been finished completely.)

- I had to find some substitute content for the work page, as my client could not provide it in time. This content is temporary and copied from a fellow Scrum master's site (http://www.pohkahkong.com/).

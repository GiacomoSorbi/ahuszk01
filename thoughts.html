            <p>
              Today, I was reminded. Reminded of the power of what we do, and
              why it matters. Sometimes (and I'm sure I'm not alone with this),
              I feel disengaged, disconnected and disenfranchised from the
              people, the teams and the organisations I'm meant to serve.
              Sometimes, I feel powerless, out of context and out of depth. And
              after days like this, when I met tons of likeminded folk at Scrum
              Exchange, I cannot be but grateful for the community that keeps me
              on my toes; that encourages and inspires me. It keeps reminding me
              of my great learnings today:
            </p>
            <p>
              1. Displaying vulnerability actually exhibits courage and trust --
              it is a sign of strength. By presenting and actually calling out
              our own weaknesses, we just become more approachable -- the mask
              of the all-knowing invincibility falls and there we are bare
              naked, frail and relatable humans made of flesh.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. Mass collaboration is probably the least efficient but quickest
              way to solve a problem which in turns just makes it the most
              effective. Today, we had to create an exercise that would be able
              to make a relevant point for a team of people. We bounced ideas on
              and off, building on one another's thoughts, inspiring and being
              inspired, which also meant that throughout this ideation session
              we created a lot of waste. Probably dozens of ideas were raised,
              observed and then canned, but eventually, we came to the one idea
              that was good enough to be presented.
            </p>
            <p>
              3. On days like this, I come home and feel energised, empowered,
              connected and hungry. Hungry for more knowledge, hungry for the
              next opportunity to learn and eager to tackle the next one waiting
              for me. It is events like this that make me try twice as hard at
              work. They make me think twice as long about my next step with my
              teams and they give me a sense of protection, security and
              belonging. I'm not alone in this. I'm following the trails of
              others but with other teams. These paths have already been walked
              by some of the people that I met today, so the trail is definitely
              viable and if they could do it with their teams, I can surely walk
              them with mine, all I have to do is figure out how.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm utterly waiting for the next moment when I feel broken so that
              I can remind myself again of the empowerment I feel now.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thank you Tobias Mayer and all my fellow participants at Scrum
              Exchange. The next one is on 29th November. It's a Friday and I'm
              coming. Are you?

            <span class="display-1">2</span> A Short Story on Failing Fast
          </h3>
          <div class="content hideContent text-white">
            <p>
              Guildford, Saturday morning. A group of teens on the ice rink.
              They look quite excited, trying to find the perfect pair of skates
              at the skate hire as though it was something you'd come across on
              your first occasion. They giggle and laugh in embarrassment, "I'm
              going to fall over, like, all the time", one says nervously.
              Finally, everybody does their laces, it's all neat and tight and
              they step on the ice for the first time ever. Legs shaking,
              fingers gripping the handrails and off they go, trying to find
              balance on two razor thin blades.
            </p>
            <p>
              Good ten minutes later, I notice one of them is trying to change
              the game. Instead of holding on to the handrail like his peers, he
              started walking on the ice just about to hold his act together. He
              slid shortly, then collapsed. He got up, tried once more and
              failed even harder, but this guy wouldn't take no for an answer.
              Once again, he stood up and started running on the slippery
              surface -- I could see his ankles shaking as they were trying to
              get used to the new sensation of being on ice. He stopped running,
              leaned forward and slid a good few metres.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fifteen minutes in, this guy was all over the place. He was
              rushing across the rink, throwing his arms around erratically
              trying to cope and keep his balance, and at times he was
              successful and remained upright but more often than not he crashed
              loud and harsh. After some of his collapses, I thought he'd be
              done, I could nearly hear his bones shatter on the concrete-hard
              ice, but he didn't care one bit about failing. The only thing he
              cared about is learning as much as possible during the little time
              allocated on the rink, and simply there is no better way to do
              that than failing often. By the end of the group's 45-minute
              session, this fella knew more about ice-skating than all of his
              peers combined -- they were still walking in baby steps next to
              the handrail though unhurt.
            </p>
            <p>
              Upon contemplating at home of what I'd seen, I just became even
              more convinced that failure is an integral part of the game. It
              takes a lot of courage to roll up your sleeve and fail frequently
              and publicly -- oh, the fear of being shamed in front of others,
              let alone your peers can be so strong that one wouldn't even want
              to try. So here is a list of things that you might want to keep in
              mind when you try something new.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Expect failure. It's not a matter of if but a matter of when.
                Chances are, you will fail immediately. No problem.
              </li>
              <li>
                Observe your failures. What did you exactly do and how? What
                parameters can you tweak to avoid failure the next time? What
                did you do well and what needs immediate improvement? Observe
                your subsequent failures in the light of the previous ones.
              </li>
              <li>
                Trust that you will be rewarded in the long run, and your reward
                will be the knowledge and experience that you have acquired due
                to your failures.
              </li>
              <li>
                Failures will not only give you scars and bruises that will
                heal, but they will also brace you with skills needed to avoid
                failing the same way twice. If you fail the same way twice, you
                didn't fail hard enough the first time.
              </li>
              <li>
                By failing frequently and fast, your learning curve becomes a
                lot steeper than it would be without your failures.
              </li>
              <li>
                Due to the skills and experience you gathered through failures,
                you are more likely to progress quicker than those who don't
                dare to step out of their comfort zone. In a way, your progress
                is limited by the number of your failures.
              </li>
              <li>
                The focus is not on not failing, but on the cycle of failing and
                learning. After crashing, start again with your new learning
                incorporated in your next attempt, and fail differently next
                time.
              </li>
              <li>
                Be open about the fact that you have never done this and you
                will fail. Most people who have ever tried something new are
                likely to be emphatic. Start from the vulnerable position and
                admit that you just don't know. Exposing vulnerability can be a
                powerful gesture.
              </li>
              <li>It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock and roll.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              In an agile environment, failure must not be avoided -- it should
              be encouraged. Scrum Masters need to break the old myth that
              failure is a weakness and/or will result in punishment. The act of
              failing is not a vulnerability -- the act of not trying due to
              fear of failure is. Failure just exposes the lack of knowledge or
              experience both of which can be remedied by failing frequently,
              fast and small.
            </p>
            <p>
              When team members try something new and don't get it right, their
              attempts should be advertised and they should be celebrated,
              especially if these trials are accompanied by tangible and
              actionable take-aways. Learning should be shared across the team
              and even the organisation because this will help others save time
              and energy of making the same mistake and communicating failures
              will hopefully result in an organisational culture that welcomes
              experimenting and is fully aware that failures will happen because
              there is no other way to figure out what works and what doesn't.
              People will thrive in an organisation if they get the feedback
              that it is okay to fail. They will never stop experimenting and
              will bring innovation which would never be possible if they had
              been told again and again that "failure is not an option" and "you
              must get this right". No, failure is definitely an option -- a
              desired one, because it is the fastest and most practical way to
              acquire knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
              As this change in the mindset starts with us, Scrum Masters, we
              also need to lead by example and be absolutely transparent about
              the experiments that we run in our teams and how unlikely it is to
              know the outcomes of these experiments. We must clearly
              communicate our failures, explain why we think we have failed, and
              ask for the insights of team members to enable us to improve our
              next experiment.

            <span class="display-1">3</span> The Anatomy of a Scrum Master's Job
            Seeking Journey
          </h3>
          <div class="content hideContent text-dark">
            <p>
              The news of unexpected redundancy hit me in mid-June and on that
              day I learned that I would be out of work by the beginning of
              August. For the first time in my adult life (also known as an
              eternity), I won't be working. It's usually not something to be
              very cheerful about and I wasn't. By the end of July, I had
              somewhat brushed up my CV and, quite worried, looked forward to
              the challenges ahead. If you look at my profile, you might
              understand why -- I had had a bit more than a year as a Scrum
              Master with my previous company and I definitely felt I needed
              more experience under my belt to be competitive in the market. The
              good thing is I was raised in a team of great people who had
              helped me understand what makes Scrum work and through our
              failures together we had a good grasp of what Scrum is and what
              isn't.
            </p>
            <p>
              By mid-August, I restructured my CV so that it highlights some of
              the skills that might be able to set me apart on the market. It is
              November now and my job hunting journey has come to an end. I have
              been in contact with 75 companies and in many cases I applied for
              several roles within the same organisation. For the sake of
              simplicity, multiple applications submitted to the same company
              will be regarded as one here.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before we jump in the data head first, I really want to place a
              disclaimer here: the data presented can, by no means, be
              considered to be a true reflection of a regular Scrum Master's job
              seeking process in general. It rather reflects my own journey with
              all the caveats and pitfalls -- and learning.
            </p>
            <p>
              Yes, learning. I really wanted to learn something through this
              lengthy and sometimes nerve-racking process and share it for the
              benefit of many so I made sure to keep all the records of my
              applications. As my search is now winding down, I put all my data
              in a sheet and created some nice graphs to visualise my findings.
              Buckle up, here we go.

              I started applying to positions nearly immediately when redundancy
              hit which means I might have applied to roles I was not exactly
              qualified for -- sometimes it was due my own desperation but more
              often than not the job descriptions were not clear enough. It
              should come as no surprise at all that only one out of five
              applications were made through referrals or recruiters who
              contacted me with roles.
            </p>
            <img
              src="img/blog post img/post-3-img-2.png"
              class="img-fluid float-right"
              alt="Pie chart"
            />
            <p>
              As a consequence of the above and also due to the nature of job
              hunting, I was only mildly surprised that
              <strong
                >two thirds of my applications received no response at
                all</strong
              >, while some applications were rejected outright. To be honest, I
              am quite grateful for these letters of rejection -- at least I, as
              an applicant, am not held in limbo about the status of my
              application. Hence,
              <strong
                >sending a letter of rejection to candidates is definitely a
                field where I think companies could do better</strong
              >. It would take hardly any effort to send a template to
              applicants stating that they were 'not considered on this
              occasion'.
            </p>
            <p>
              So there was no response sent for two thirds of my applications;
              however, nearly one in four applications did receive a response,
              and before digging deeper, I really wanted to find out if there is
              a correlation between the responsiveness of companies and whether
              the applications were submitted by me, by recruiters on behalf of
              me or through referrals -- mainly former colleagues or
              acquaintances whose current companies were hiring Scrum Masters or
              people in my profession in general.
            </p>
            <img
              src="img/blog post img/post-3-img-3.png"
              class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block"
              alt="Bar chart"
            />
            <p>
              45% of applications made by recruiters were picked up by
              prospective companies, whilst this rate is merely 16% if you are a
              random applicant from LinkedIn like me. To put it an other way,
              <strong
                >applications through recruiters were three times as likely to
                raise interest with prospective employers</strong
              >. Also, all applications that were made through referrals were
              picked up in my case. Thank you folks, indeed!
            </p>
            <p>
              Theoretically then, you just need a good network to land on
              interviews eventually, right? Well, this is not necessarily the
              case as the next graph will show:
            </p>
            <img
              src="img/blog post img/post-3-img-4.png"
              class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block"
              alt="Bar chart"
            />
            <p>
              It is true that your network and recruiters representing you have
              better chances to start your phone ringing, but if you are
              relentless you will easily outperform them. Looking at the numbers
              only in this graph, you will see that more of my own applications
              were picked up than recruiters' and referrals' applications
              combined.
            </p>
            <h4>It's great to hear from you!</h4>
            <p>
              What I was also eager to find out is the response rate in general:
              how long does it take for companies to come back to us mere
              mortals:
            </p>
            <img
              src="img/blog post img/post-3-img-5.png"
              class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block"
              alt="Bar chart"
            />
            <p>
              80% of the companies that get back to you, do so within 14
              calendar days, and 75% of those wanting to take the process
              further responded in just seven days.
              <strong
                >Half the companies that were definitely interested in me
                responded the day after my application was submitted.</strong
              >
            </p>
            <h4>I hope to meet you soon!</h4>
            <p>
              Finally, let's see how well those interviews went. For the sake of
              simplicity, I broke down the interview types as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Initial interview: The first point of contact with the company
                -- usually with an internal or external recruiter working for
                your future employer. You get to know a bit about the role and
                the company, and then you chat about your CV. Nothing too
                serious really.
              </li>
              <li>
                Phone interview: This is when you get to speak with some
                like-minded folk, in most cases they are your future colleagues
                or would-be boss. This is now the real deal, you do get into the
                nitty-gritty of agile. For us Scrum Masters, the discussion is
                about your agile experience but it is not uncommon to face
                situational questions as well in addition to Scrum theory and
                Agile methodologies in general.
              </li>
              <li>
                F2F interview: Finally, you get to meet face to face. This step
                takes a few hours and you will talk to a wide range of people --
                usually in a few rounds. Mostly, these stages are completed on
                the same day so you speak with a few product owners first then,
                after a quick break, you continue with some Scrum Masters or
                Agile Coaches, etc. Depending on the company, you might be
                invited back one more time to meet a senior manager but in most
                cases this step is just an additional sanity check -- the
                decision is likely to have been made by then.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Once you have completed all the interviews, you may or may not get
              an offer which you may or may not accept. So without any further
              ado, I present to you...
            </p>
            <img
              src="img/blog post img/post-3-img-6.png"
              class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block"
              alt="Bar chart"
            />
            <p>
              ... this chart which shows the stages that I completed during my
              job hunting journey. Mind you, each stage builds on the previous
              one, the "Phone Interview" stage means that I have successfully
              sailed through the initial interviews, and the "F2F Interview"
              also implies that I have concluded the initial and phone interview
              stages. I hope this is clear. So let's see the main findings:
            </p>
            <p>
              I passed two out of three initial interviews which basically means
              that
              <strong
                >once my application was picked up, I was likely to get to the
                more agile-focused interview steps</strong
              >, and I was more or less comfortable to whizz through the phone
              interview stage as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong
                >About half the time when a company responded to my application,
                I was invited into their offices for a face-to-face
                interview.</strong
              >
              Obviously, this is when parties have the opportunity to discover
              one another. Recruitment should really be a two-way street: it is
              not only about them finding out if they would want to work with
              you -- you also need to be positive about wanting to work with
              them. You need to be enthusiastic about going to work in that
              office with those people; otherwise, it cannot really be a
              fruitful and healthy work relationship.
            </p>
            <p>
              And finally, the good news and a powerful reminder for the future
              for me is that
              <strong
                >about one in five of those casual chit-chats with the lovely HR
                person over the phone will actually lead to an offer from that
                company</strong
              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finding your next role can be a real struggle at times. It is a
              wild, wild roller coaster with completely unexpected ups and downs
              and dips and incredibly tight turns. One thing is sure, however:
              the ride will come to an end eventually, and you will take one of
              those offers, probably to your own professional benefit as well as
              to the benefit of the company you will work for.
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, here is what I learned:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Dear Companies, brush up your hiring processes a bit please. If
                you have shortlisted 25 candidates you want to move forward
                with, let the others know that you are not going to consider
                their applications. It means the world to us. Really. Thanks.
              </li>
              <li>
                Recruiters work. Or maybe it was just me that was lucky, but I
                was three times as likely to receive a positive response to an
                application when it was submitted by a recruiter. Nevertheless,
                you must apply relentlessly as well.
              </li>
              <li>
                They will reach out soon, if they want to talk to you. This
                point may be related to the first one. If you don't hear back
                for two weeks, chances are your application has been binned.
              </li>
              <li>
                In my case, half the time my application was picked up, I landed
                on a face to face interview, and about a third of those
                interviews ended with me getting an offer in my hand.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              I know it is not easy at times but have faith in yourself. If I
              can do it, anyone can do it.
            </p>
            <p>Good luck!</p>

              Scrum is a simple framework to understand but it is not easy to
              execute. Many Scrum teams failed as they uses a lot of workarounds
              called Scrumbuts in the hope to optimize the process without a
              clear understanding of Scrum. As a Scrum Master, my role is to
              ensure that the team have the Agile maturity to run Scrum
              effectively by coaching them to understand and apply Agile
              principles and practices diligently.

              For Development Team, I coach them on Agile Engineering Best
              Practices, including Test Driven Driven (TDD) and Continuous
              Integration (CI) and work closely with the Technical Lead to pair
              the junior developer to the senior developer for practice.

              I cannot recommend Gabor enough as a scrum team member. In a
              complex technical environment, with difficult dependencies and
              client needs, he has the maturity and expressive capability you
              really need. On top of his excellent technical writing skills, he
              has trained on the job to become a scrum master, and this is
              somewhere his unique skills really work well. He pulls people
              together. He fosters trust and respect in the team. He solves
              problems. Go with Gabor!

              The objective of release planning is to estimate which features
              will be delivered by the release deadline (fixed release
              deadline), or to choose a rough delivery date for a given set of
              features (fixed scope). As a Business Analyst, I assist Product
              Owner to list out all the high level features (Epics) at the top
              row to kickstart the release planning. Then I will work with
              Development Team to list out all the user stories under the
              respective Epic, in the order of dependency from top to bottom.

              This is a great game that Scrum Masters use to help people
              understand what is Scrum like. In this game, participants are
              asked to perform simple, everyday tasks in ways they haven’t
              thought of before. Each task evokes conversations about
              complexity, prioritisation, dependencies, acceptance criteria and
              teaches a few things about the five values of Scrum.

              I had the pleasure of working with Gabor at Leo Tech. Originally a
              Technical Author, he moved into a ScrumMaster role to great
              effect, was able to transfer a lot of his skills and develop new
              ones to fill the role. Gabor is a great communicator and can work
              with both inexperienced and experienced team members to get the
              best out of them and take a Scrum team forward. He can deal with
              team conflicts, identify and remove impediments, brings a positive
              energy to a team, and adopts new practices to further his skills.

              Scrum is one of the most structure methodology of Agile with
              several key Sprint Ceremonies, namely Daily Standup, Sprint
              Planning, Product Backlog Refinement, Sprint Retrospective and
              Sprint Review, to shorten feedback loop. As a Scrum Master, I
              conduct these ceremonies at the start of the project to bring in
              structure to the development. During each the ceremonies, I coach
              Product Owner and Development team on why and how to run the
              ceremonies effectively and also optimize the ceremonies over time
              to suit the nature of the team.

              One of the main concern of growing Agile teams is that Scrum
              Master may become the bottleneck if the team is always dependent
              on Scrum Master. So as part of the Agile adoption process, I will
              gradually take a back seat and let the team take over the
              ceremonies as the team grow in Agile maturity. In this way, the
              team will collaborate directly and become independent with
              ownership, allowing them to become truly self-organized.

              The ultimate goal of any product development projects is to
              deliver the product effectively, so as a Scrum Master I help the
              team to perform at their highest level by removing any impediments
              to progress. To identify impediments, I conduct Sprint
              Retrospective to collect feedback from Development Team. One of
              the technique I used is called "Glad, Sad, Mad", where the team
              will talk about their emotions through the Sprint. From the
              negative emotions, I will identify the problems that caused them
              which are usually the impediments.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
              Impediments can be anything, so I have to be creative and flexible
              to solve them. For example, it can be that Product Backlog is not
              ready, so I will work closely with Product Owner to refine the
              backlog. Or it can be two of the team members are not
              communicating due to personal issues, so I will become the
              mediator and counsellor between them to resolve their conflicts to
              get them talking to each other again.

              As a Business Analyst in a large organisation, I am dealing with
              users or clients with complex workflow in their day to day
              operation, so I use Business Process Modelling (BPM) to model out
              the workflow for better analysis and communication with Product
              Owner, Scrum Master and Development Team.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
              To model the workflow, I will work closely with Product Owner to
              conduct Product Conceptualisation sessions with the users. This
              involves the users mapping out their current workflow and
              indicating what is their wishlists and painpoints at the various
              stages of the workflow. With this information, I will work out
              workflows using BPM to satisfy most the concerns and work
              iteratively with the users for feedback for enhancement.
